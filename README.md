## ✨ Why choose CodeGate?

AI coding assistants are powerful, but they can inadvertently introduce risks.
CodeGate protects your development process by:

- 🔒 Preventing accidental exposure of secrets and sensitive data
- 🛡️ Ensuring AI suggestions follow secure coding practices
- ⚠️ Blocking recommendations of known malicious or deprecated libraries
- 🔍 Providing real-time security analysis of AI suggestions

---

## 🚀 Quickstart

### Prerequisites

CodeGate is distributed as a Docker container. You need a container runtime like
Docker Desktop or Docker Engine. Podman and Podman Desktop are also supported.
CodeGate works on Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems with x86_64 and
arm64 (ARM and Apple Silicon) CPU architectures.

These instructions assume the `docker` CLI is available. If you use Podman,
replace `docker` with `podman` in all commands.

### Installation

To start CodeGate, run this simple command:

```bash
docker run --name codegate -d -p 8989:8989 -p 9090:9090 -p 8990:8990 \
  --mount type=volume,src=codegate_volume,dst=/app/codegate_volume \
  --restart unless-stopped ghcr.io/stacklok/codegate:latest
```

That’s it! CodeGate is now running locally. 

### Get into action
Now it's time to configure your preferred AI coding assistant to use CodeGate
[See supported AI Coding Assistants and providers](#-supported-ai-coding-assistants-and-providers)

⚙️ For advanced configurations and parameter references, check out the
[CodeGate Install and Upgrade](https://docs.codegate.ai/how-to/install)
documentation.

## 🖥️ Dashboard

CodeGate includes a web dashboard that provides:

- A view of **security risks** detected by CodeGate
- A **history of interactions** between your AI coding assistant and your LLM

## 🔐 Features

### Secrets encryption

CodeGate helps you protect sensitive information from being accidentally exposed
to AI models and third-party AI provider systems by redacting detected secrets
from your prompts using encryption.
[Learn more](https://docs.codegate.ai/features/secrets-encryption)

### Dependency risk awareness

LLMs’ knowledge cutoff date is often months or even years in the past. They
might suggest outdated, vulnerable, or non-existent packages (hallucinations),
exposing you and your users to security risks.

CodeGate scans direct, transitive, and development dependencies in your package
definition files, installation scripts, and source code imports that you supply
as context to an LLM.
[Learn more](https://docs.codegate.ai/features/dependency-risk)

### Security reviews

CodeGate performs security-centric code reviews, identifying insecure patterns
or potential vulnerabilities to help you adopt more secure coding practices.
