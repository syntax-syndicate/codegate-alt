## Introduction

CodeGate is a local gateway that makes AI coding assistants safer. CodeGate
ensures AI-generated recommendations adhere to best practices, while
safeguarding your code's integrity, and protecting your individual privacy. With
CodeGate, you can confidently leverage AI in your development workflow without
compromising security or productivity. CodeGate is designed to work seamlessly
with coding assistants, allowing you to safely enjoy all the benefits of AI code
generation.

CodeGate is developed by [Stacklok](https://stacklok.com), a group of security
experts with many years of experience building developer friendly open source
security software tools and platforms.

Check out the CodeGate **[website](https://codegate.ai)** and

Refer to the CodeGate docs for more information:

- [Using CodeGate](https://docs.codegate.ai/how-to)
- [CodeGate features](https://docs.codegate.ai/features)

## 🛠️ Development

Check out the developer reference guides:

- [Development guide](./docs/development.md)
- [CLI commands and flags](./docs/cli.md)
- [Configuration system](./docs/configuration.md)
- [Logging system](./docs/logging.md)

### Local setup

```bash
# Get the code
git clone https://github.com/stacklok/codegate.git
cd codegate

# Set up virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dev dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Running locally with several network interfaces

By default weaviate is picking the default route as the ip for the cluster
nodes. It may cause some issues when dealing with multiple interfaces. To make
it work, localhost needs to be the default route:

```bash
sudo route delete default
sudo route add default 127.0.0.1
sudo route add -net 0.0.0.0/1 <public_ip_gateway>
sudo route add -net 128.0.0.0/1 <public_ip_gateway>
```

### Testing

```bash
pytest
```

## 🐳 Docker deployment

### Build the image

```bash
make image-build
```

### Run the container

```bash
# Basic usage with local image
docker run -p 8989:8989 -p 9090:80 codegate:latest

# With pre-built pulled image
docker pull ghcr.io/stacklok/codegate:latest
docker run --name codegate -d -p 8989:8989 -p 9090:80 ghcr.io/stacklok/codegate:latest

# It will mount a volume to /app/codegate_volume
# The directory supports storing Llama CPP models under subidrectoy /models
# A sqlite DB with the messages and alerts is stored under the subdirectory /db
docker run --name codegate -d -v /path/to/volume:/app/codegate_volume -p 8989:8989 -p 9090:80 ghcr.io/stacklok/codegate:latest
```
