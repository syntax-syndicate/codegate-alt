## How to contribute

### Using GitHub Issues

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and enhancements. If you have a general usage
question, please ask in
[CodeGate's discussion forum](https://discord.gg/stacklok).

If you are reporting a bug, please help to speed up problem diagnosis by
providing as much information as possible. Ideally, that would include a small
sample project that reproduces the problem.

["good first issue"](https://github.com/stacklok/codegate/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
are a great place to start!

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
1. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
1. Capitalize the subject line
1. Do not end the subject line with a period
1. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
1. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
